# Quantum Safe TLS Proxy Architecture

## Overview
The Quantum Safe TLS Proxy provides a secure proxy for communication, using quantum-safe encryption to future-proof data security. It supports deployment across multiple cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Key Components
1. **Proxy Server**:
   - Acts as a gateway for incoming requests, handling TLS termination, quantum-safe encryption, and routing.
   - Built using Envoy/NGINX, configured to support quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms.

2. **Load Balancer / Gateway**:
   - Manages traffic distribution across multiple proxy instances.
   - Uses cloud-native solutions (e.g., AWS ALB, Azure Application Gateway, GCP Load Balancer).

3. **Backend Services**:
   - Service instances that process incoming requests.
   - Hosted within a secure network (e.g., private VPC/subnet).

## Technology Stack
- **Envoy/NGINX**: For TLS termination and reverse proxying.
- **Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon**: Quantum-safe algorithms used for securing communication.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for multi-cloud deployments.
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting.

## Deployment Flows
### AWS
- Uses ECS for container orchestration, with security groups to restrict network access.
- Deployed behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

### Azure
- Uses AKS for container orchestration.
- Deployed behind an Azure Application Gateway with an associated Network Security Group.

### GCP
- Uses Cloud Run for serverless deployment.
- Configured with GCP's Cloud Load Balancing and firewall rules.

## Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances of the proxy server to handle increased load.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase CPU and memory allocation for existing proxy instances.
- **Auto-scaling Policies**: Use cloud-native auto-scaling based on metrics like CPU utilization or incoming request count.
