# Security Guidelines for Quantum Safe TLS Proxy

## Overview
The Quantum Safe TLS Proxy uses quantum-safe encryption algorithms to ensure future-proof data protection. This document outlines security practices, incident response procedures, and security monitoring.

## Encryption Standards
- **Quantum-Safe Algorithms**: Supports Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon.
- **TLS Configuration**: Use TLS 1.3 and only allow strong ciphers.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security issue, please report it immediately to `security@quantumsafetlsproxy.org`.

## Security Controls
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls, security groups, and VPCs to limit network exposure.
- **Certificate Management**: Rotate certificates every 90 days.
- **Monitoring**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.

## Incident Response
1. **Detect**: Monitor logs and alerts for suspicious activity.
2. **Assess**: Determine the scope and impact of the incident.
3. **Contain**: Isolate affected components.
4. **Eradicate**: Remove any malicious content or access.
5. **Recover**: Restore services to a secure state.
6. **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct a review to prevent future incidents.

## Security Audits
- **Vulnerability Scans**: Run weekly using `security/vulnerability_scan.sh`.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conducted quarterly by an external security firm.
