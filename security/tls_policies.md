# TLS/SSL Policies and Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the TLS/SSL policies for securing communications. The goal is to ensure that all communications are encrypted using strong encryption algorithms and configurations that meet or exceed industry standards.

## Supported TLS Versions
- **TLS 1.3** (Preferred)
- **TLS 1.2** (Minimum supported)

TLS 1.1 and older versions are not supported due to known vulnerabilities.

## Cipher Suites
The following cipher suites are recommended:
1. **TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384** (TLS 1.3)
2. **TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256** (TLS 1.3)
3. **TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384** (TLS 1.2)

Avoid using weak ciphers such as those based on RC4, DES, or MD5.

## Certificate Management
- Use certificates signed by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
- Certificates should be rotated every 12 months or sooner if needed.
- Use at least a 2048-bit key size for RSA or 256-bit for ECDSA.

## Recommended Practices
1. **Enable Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)** to ensure session keys are not compromised.
2. **Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** to enforce HTTPS connections.
3. **Use OCSP stapling** to improve the performance of certificate revocation checks.
4. **Automate certificate renewal** processes to avoid downtime.
